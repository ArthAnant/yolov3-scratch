# YOLOv3 from scratch
<p>This is a pytorch implementation of the YOLOv3 algorithm</p>
<p>The model is trained on the coco datastet to detect 80 object classes</p>
<p>To run this on your local machine, copy this repository using: - https://github.com/ArthAnant/yolov3-scratch.git
<p>And open up a command line to type in pip install -r requirements.txt</p>
<p>After these steps you should be able to run the yolo_algo.ipynb file</p>
<p>To test the algorithm on a custom image</p>
<p>Goto yolo_exec file and to cell number 7, and change the path from photo_filename = 'istockphoto-484348057-612x612.jpg' to your desired path</p>
